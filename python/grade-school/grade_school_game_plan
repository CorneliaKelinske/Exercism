Grades and students are key : value pairs --> dictionary
Set up said dictionary in init.

for add student:
use my dictionary and append my student to the list that is the value to the respective grade (key)
(use sorted to make list alphabetically)


roster : maybe some kind of loop, where I append the sorted students of the respectively min.key in the dict to a list.
then delet said key value pairs

grade: gives a sorted list of the students in said grade.
