need to read up on classes again
i need a 'Garden' class that takes in a string, representing the plants in two lines.
each child has two pots (aka letters) per lines
 a dictionary to assign letters to plants
 i want to split the two lines into two lists
 each kid has certain slices of these lists
 dict to match each kid to its slice
 and a garden.plants method that returns the plants for a given kid.
