maybe better idea:
convert everything into minutes and add up

call that variable self.total_minutes

divide total minutes by 60 to get total hours
modulus is self.minutes

06 November:
Next challenge negative minutes roll over
Clock (1, -160) is 22:20

09 November
if my hours are negative and modulus is 0, then I do not need to deduct another hour
I am deducting one hour too much when hour is negative


13 November
need to work on adding seconds and rolling over to next hour
