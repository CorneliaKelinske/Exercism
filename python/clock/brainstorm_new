maybe better idea:
convert everything into minutes and add up

call that variable self.total_minutes

divide total minutes by 60 to get total hours
modulus is self.minutes

06 November:
Next challenge negative minutes roll over
Clock (1, -160) is 22:20

09 November
I do get the right amount of hours to subtract from 24.
Need to find out why I am not getting down to 22, but only to 23.

so start after first if loop
