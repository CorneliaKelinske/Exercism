?????
- need to look at the minutes first
- 1st question: is second number < 60: wenn ja, second number bleibt second number
if not:
- add int(second number/60) to first number
- second number = second number % 60

question: hopefully first number is adjusted and remains adjusted

- look at first number:
if number is < 23: number remains number

and then I guess I might need some while loop?!!! aaaaahhh
