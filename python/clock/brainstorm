- need to look at the minutes first
- 1st question: is second number < 60: wenn ja, second number bleibt second number
if not:
- add int(second number/60) to first number
- second number = second number % 60

question: hopefully first number is adjusted and remains adjusted

- look at first number:
if number is < 23: number remains number

maybe need to divide by 24 and then use the modulus... YES

for negative numbers:
need to work with abs(number)

need to subtract minutes from 60
and hours from 24 

guess modulus stuff will be similar to positive

NEXT: see where another hour is deducted in current scenario
To this end: I have added print statements.

On to add minutes:

16 November
came across the divmod function
next: look at next failed test; adding across midnight

02 December
maybe reorganize so that all the conversion is done in a separate function

16 December
trying to find out why my plan does not work
it works now
next step: implement the "add minutes"
implemented; started running tests -- so far so good

20 December:
Subtracting all works fine.
Starting on the equal to thing.
Problem: I have no idea how to get to that second argument, which is again an instance of "Clock"
