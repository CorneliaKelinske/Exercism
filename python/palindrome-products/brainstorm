1. Get all the products within the range:
add them to a dictionary
not a dictionary comprehension, because it will have to be a bit more complicated:
    product is the key, if key is already in dict, I need to append the factors.
    -> dict values must be lists with tuples
then, i can check which keys are palindromes (if their reversed string is identical to their string form), 
keep them by way of dict comprehension?
then, eliminate duplicates in the factors... maybe by ordering them by value????
And then check for the smallest or largest palindrome
