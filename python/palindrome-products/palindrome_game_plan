1. Function that gets me the products and the factors as a dictionary.
    - figure out a way to avoid duplication; idea: multiply each number with itself and all the numbers higher than itself
    - output is {product : (factor1, factor2)}

2. Function that checks if a number is a palindrome
    - convert int into a string
    - reverse string
    - compare strings
    - if identical: true

3. the actual functions:
    - run the get_product function on the range
    - run the is_palindrome function on the products
    - find the max or min and then figure out a way to return it with all available factors

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

And this game plan above did not work...

1. I get all the products, but not the factors. Each number is only included once.

2. Later I cannot properly iterate over the dictionary

3. New idea: function to get all the products. Work with a list of tuples instead of dict.
